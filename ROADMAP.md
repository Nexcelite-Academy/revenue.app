- [ ] Data backup and restore
- [ ] Bulk data import
- [ ] Report scheduling

**Priority**: LOW  
**Estimated Time**: 1-2 hours

### Phase 5: Production Readiness
**Goal**: Prepare for deployment and scaling

#### Milestone 5.1: Testing & Quality
- [ ] Unit tests for all models
- [ ] API endpoint testing
- [ ] Integration tests
- [ ] Performance optimization

**Priority**: MEDIUM  
**Estimated Time**: 2-3 hours

#### Milestone 5.2: Deployment Setup
- [ ] Docker containerization
- [ ] Environment configuration
- [ ] Database migration scripts
- [ ] Production deployment guide

**Priority**: LOW  
**Estimated Time**: 1-2 hours

## Current Sprint (Active)

### Sprint Goal: Backend Foundation ‚úÖ COMPLETED
**Duration**: Current session  
**Focus**: Set up backend infrastructure and basic models

### Tasks Completed:
1. ‚úÖ **Flask application setup** - Complete backend directory structure created
2. ‚úÖ **Database models** - All SQLAlchemy models defined with relationships
3. ‚úÖ **Complete API endpoints** - CRUD operations for all entities
4. ‚úÖ **Advanced features** - Reports, statistics, CSV export, balance management
5. ‚úÖ **Business logic** - Automatic balance updates, validation, error handling

### Success Criteria:
- [x] Backend server running locally ‚úÖ
- [x] Database created with all tables ‚úÖ
- [x] Basic API endpoints responding ‚úÖ
- [x] Sample data seeded successfully ‚úÖ
- [x] Advanced business logic implemented ‚úÖ

## Risk Assessment

### High Risk Items:
1. **Data Migration**: Moving from in-memory to database without losing existing logic
2. **Frontend Integration**: Maintaining current UI while switching to API calls
3. **Calculation Logic**: Ensuring business rules work correctly with persistent data

### Mitigation Strategies:
1. Incremental development with frequent testing
2. Keep existing frontend code as reference
3. Implement comprehensive validation and error handling

## Next Session Planning

### Immediate Priorities:
1. Complete backend setup (Flask + SQLAlchemy)
2. Create all database models
3. Implement basic CRUD API endpoints
4. Test API functionality

### Future Sessions:
1. Integrate frontend with backend API
2. Implement advanced business logic
3. Add comprehensive testing
4. Prepare for deployment
